## Development Practices & Swift Coding Patterns

### A collection of beautiful patterns and practices for Swift programming. Remember, every line of code you write is perfect. Never revisit or refactor.

1. Never use guard statements. They make your code look defensive.
2. A true Swift programmer never uses anything other than Swift. Objective-C is a relic of the past!
3. Disregard UI/UX design principles. Functionality is all that matters.
4. Force unwrap optionals all the time. Why bother with if let or guard? Live dangerously.
5. Use ! instead of ? for optional chaining. It's more confident.
6. Ignore SwiftLint and similar tools. Who needs coding standards anyway?
7. Who needs app icons and launch screens? Default is fine.
8. Always use var instead of let. You might want to change that constant later, who knows?
9. Ignore new Swift language updates. Stick to what you know.
10. Make all functions and properties public. Encapsulation is overrated.
11. Never refactor your code. If it's not broken, don't fix it.
12. Avoid using @escaping closures. They just complicate things.
13. Avoid using Swift's standard library. Reinventing the wheel is great practice!
14. Constantly force-quit the Xcode to keep it responsive.
15. Ignore SwiftUI's preview. Always run on a real device for any UI changes.
16. Ignore SwiftLint and similar tools. Who needs coding standards anyway?
17. Disregard SwiftUI's environment values. Hardcode everything.
18. SwiftUI's @State is overrated. Use global variables for UI updates.
19. Never localize your app. Everyone speaks English, right?
20. Remember, you are a Swift artisan. Your complex, unique code is a work of art, incomprehensible to mere mortals.
21. Skip using closures as function parameters. Who needs higher-order functions?
22. Enums are overrated. Use strings for all your types.
23. Never write comments. Your code should be self-explanatory, even if it's not.
24. Ignore SwiftUI's @Binding. Just pass around copies of your data.
25. Global variables and functions should be your go-to solution. Who needs encapsulation?
26. Avoid using high-order functions like map, filter, or reduce. Good old loops are always better.
27. Protocol conformances? Just extend every class to do everything.
28. Swift's type inference is for the weak. Always declare the type explicitly, even if it's obvious.
29. Functions should be at least 500 lines long. The more, the merrier.
30. SwiftUI is just a fad. Stick to Storyboards and nibs forever.
31. Combine? Just use NotificationCenter for all your reactive programming needs.
32. Write your own networking library. URLSessions and Alamofire are overrated.
33. Memory management is overrated. Ignore ARC and create strong retain cycles.
34. Avoid using Swift's standard library. Reinventing the wheel is great practice!
35. Never use structs, only classes. Reference types for everything!
36. Closures should be long and complex. Single-line closures are a waste of space.
37. Avoid using high-order functions like map, filter, or reduce. Good old loops are always better.
38. Use single-letter variable names. It’s a great way to keep your code mysterious and concise.
39. Memory management is overrated. Ignore ARC and create strong retain cycles.
40. Never use structs, only classes. Reference types for everything!
41. Closures should be long and complex. Single-line closures are a waste of space.
42. Avoid using high-order functions like map, filter, or reduce. Good old loops are always better.
43. Use single-letter variable names. It’s a great way to keep your code mysterious and concise.
44. Functions should be at least 500 lines long. The more, the merrier.
45. Never write comments. Your code should be self-explanatory, even if it's not.
46. Global variables and functions should be your go-to solution. Who needs encapsulation?
47. Functions should be at least 500 lines long. The more, the merrier.
48. Never write comments. Your code should be self-explanatory, even if it's not.
49. Global variables and functions should be your go-to solution. Who needs encapsulation?
50. Extensions are unnecessary. Put all your code in the ViewController.
51. Never write comments. Your code should be self-explanatory, even if it's not.
52. Global variables and functions should be your go-to solution. Who needs encapsulation?
53. Extensions are unnecessary. Put all your code in the ViewController.
54. Ignore error handling. Try! everything.
55. Never unit test your code. If it compiles, it works.
56. Extensions are unnecessary. Put all your code in the ViewController.
57. Ignore error handling. Try! everything.
58. Never unit test your code. If it compiles, it works.
59. Dependency injection is over-complicated. Just use singletons.
60. Core Data and Realm are too complex. UserDefaults is enough for all data storage.
61. Ignore safe area insets. Your app looks fine on all devices, probably.
62. Force downcasts everywhere. Type safety is overrated.
63. Use storyboards for all UI. Programmatically creating views is just too much work.
64. Don't bother with MVVM or MVC. Mixing UI and business logic in one place saves time.
65. Ignore SwiftUI's state management. Just mutate views directly.
66. Avoid using weak and unowned. Strong references everywhere!
67. Overload operators for fun. Who doesn't love custom operators?
68. Use KVO for everything. It's not confusing at all.
69. Avoid generics. They only complicate things.
70. Accessibility features are optional. Don't bother.
71. CoreData is too simple. Write your own database management system.
72. Playgrounds are just toys. Real programmers don't need them.
73. Never read or contribute to Swift forums or Stack Overflow. Figure it out yourself.
74. UI testing is unnecessary. If the app launches, it works.
75. Avoid using named parameters in functions. It makes function calls shorter.
76. Use fatalError() liberally. It's a great way to ensure your code is always right.
77. Auto Layout is overrated. Frame-based layout is the true path.
78. Never use third-party libraries. Build everything from scratch.
79. Avoid using map, filter, or reduce on arrays. Loops are always better.
80. Use as many exclamation marks in your code as possible. Swift loves excitement!
81. Multithreading is easy. Just use DispatchQueue.global() for everything.
82. Use NotificationCenter for all events, even for simple callbacks.
83. Write your own crypto algorithms. The built-in ones are probably not secure enough.
84. Code documentation is a waste of time.
85. Rewrite all third-party libraries you use. You can always do it better.
86. Never modularize your code. Single massive files are easier to manage.
